							<p class="detail">This project is a graduation work from creative design course in 2017.</br>It started with a question that “ Why every microwave is in rectangular shape?”. A “Pollo” is a roundish heating appliance with microwave and induction functions. With this roundish shape, it can raise the space efficiency. Also, it brought a design motif in the shape of a chicken.</p>
